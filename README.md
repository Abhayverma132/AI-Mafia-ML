This is a basic problem of Machine Learning using the Linear Regression algorithm.

The problem statement is that a training dataset is given which comprises of 5 features which affect Air Quality Index(AQI) and the corresponding AQI. Based on this training dataset, we have to predict the AQI based on the 5 input features.

Linear Regression is a technique to generate the best fit line according to the dataset and predict according to that line. This line may have any number of dimensions ( 5 Dimensional in this case ). This simple project is an important application of this technique and gives very good results when the data is nearly linear in nature.

This is a basic problem of Machine Learning using the Linear Regression algorithm.

The problem statement is that a training dataset is given which comprises of the Time devoted by a person and his/her corresponding performance level. Based on this training dataset, we have to predict the performance of set of persons based on their time devoted.

Linear Regression is a technique to generate the best fit line according to the dataset and predict according to that line.

This simple project may be extended to many applications in scenarios when we have to predict something based on some features provided that the data is nearly linear in nature for better results.
